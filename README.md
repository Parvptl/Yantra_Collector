# Yantra_Collector
This project implements AI search techniques to solve the Yantra Hunt puzzle. The player must navigate a grid, collecting yantras in a specified sequence while avoiding traps and walls, and ultimately reach the exit. The solution uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms to find optimal paths
